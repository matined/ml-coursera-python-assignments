    "In this exercise, you will implement linear regression and get to see it work on data. Before starting on this programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the information you need for solving this assignment is in this notebook, and all the code you will be implementing will take place within this notebook. The assignment can be promptly submitted to the coursera grader directly from this notebook (code and instructions are included below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin with the exercises, we need to import all libraries required for this programming exercise. Throughout the course, we will be using [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) for all arrays and matrix operations, and [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting.\n",

    "You can find instructions on how to install required libraries in the README file in the [github repository](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments)."

    "- Python array indices start from zero, not one (contrary to OCTAVE/MATLAB). \n",
    "\n",
    "- There is an important distinction between python arrays (called `list` or `tuple`) and `numpy` arrays. You should use `numpy` arrays in all your computations. Vector/matrix operations work only with `numpy` arrays. Python lists do not support vector operations (you need to use for loops).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are seeing many errors at runtime, inspect your matrix operations to make sure that you are adding and multiplying matrices of compatible dimensions. Printing the dimensions of `numpy` arrays using the `shape` property will help you debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By default, `numpy` interprets math operators to be element-wise operators. If you want to do matrix multiplication, you need to use the `dot` function in `numpy`. For, example if `A` and `B` are two `numpy` matrices, then the matrix operation AB is `np.dot(A, B)`. Note that for 2-dimensional matrices or vectors (1-dimensional), this is also equivalent to `A@B` (requires python >= 3.5)."

    "\n",
    "In this part of the exercise, you will get to try out different learning rates for the dataset and find a learning rate that converges quickly. You can change the learning rate by modifying the following code and changing the part of the code that sets the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use your implementation of `gradientDescentMulti` function and run gradient descent for about 50 iterations at the chosen learning rate. The function should also return the history of $J(\\theta)$ values in a vector $J$.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the last iteration, plot the J values against the number of the iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you picked a learning rate within a good range, your plot look similar as the following Figure. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](Figures/learning_rate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If your graph looks very different, especially if your value of $J(\\theta)$ increases or even blows up, adjust your learning rate and try again. We recommend trying values of the learning rate $\\alpha$ on a log-scale, at multiplicative steps of about 3 times the previous value (i.e., 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01 and so on). You may also want to adjust the number of iterations you are running if that will help you see the overall trend in the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "**Implementation Note:** If your learning rate is too large, $J(\\theta)$ can diverge and ‘blow up’, resulting in values which are too large for computer calculations. In these situations, `numpy` will tend to return\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "**MATPLOTLIB tip:** To compare how different learning learning rates affect convergence, it is helpful to plot $J$ for several learning rates on the same figure. This can be done by making `alpha` a python list, and looping across the values within this list, and calling the plot function in every iteration of the loop. It is also useful to have a legend to distinguish the different lines within the plot. Search online for `pyplot.legend` for help on showing legends in `matplotlib`.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the changes in the convergence curves as the learning rate changes. With a small learning rate, you should find that gradient descent takes a very long time to converge to the optimal value. Conversely, with a large learning rate, gradient descent might not converge or might even diverge!\n",
    "Using the best learning rate that you found, run the script\n",
    "to run gradient descent until convergence to find the final values of $\\theta$. Next,\n",
    "use this value of $\\theta$ to predict the price of a house with 1650 square feet and\n",
